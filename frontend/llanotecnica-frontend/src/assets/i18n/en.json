  "PRODUCTS_PAGE.MT-370.DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "Perfect for mid-scale construction tasks, this mixer offers a 370L drum with 360° rotation for flexible loading and versatile discharge positions. Its tubular T-reinforced chassis and optimized drum vanes ensure efficient mixing and extended durability. A V-belt transmission minimizes vibration, while pedal-controlled positioning and cast iron-toothed parts simplify single-operator use. Built from highly resistant steel, the MT-370 stands up to continuous mixing demands on every worksite.",
  "PRODUCTS_PAGE.MT-480.DETAILED_DESCRIPTION": "Built for large-scale construction needs, this mixer features a 420L drum with 360° rotation for enhanced loading and multiple discharge positions. Its tubular T-reinforced chassis and optimized blade vanes provide reliable, high-volume performance. A V-belt transmission reduces vibrations for smoother operation, while pedal-controlled positioning and cast iron-toothed parts enable single-operator handling. The MT-480 thrives under continuous mixing in demanding jobsites.",
